# Modularizing-Air-Quality-Sensor
## Description:
Our goal is to create an easy to make and affordable air quality sensor kit that people can make at home. It will have potential modifications so the user can customize it to their needs/wants. It will have a website with instructions on how to build it. There could be pre-built ones, to make it more accessible as well. It could have a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module that would link to a database displaying all the sensor readings on a map.
